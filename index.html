                    <p>The GEL Test Rig is a tool designed to provide simple and clear feedback for maintainers of webpages and code libraries that implement the BBC Global Experience Language (GEL). It provides feature descriptions which capture our approved GEL patterns using the <em>testable</em> BDD-style specification&mdash;Given, When, Then&mdash;in order to encourage test-driven design. The test rig provides an easy to use tool that can interrogate your web page and provide red/green feedback to quickly reveal precisely which patterns your implementation adhere to, and any that your implementation do not.</p>

                    <p>The Test Rig requires a "sampler page" that will serve as the test subject, and which will be examined and compared to the GEL patterns definions.</p>

                    <p>If you have created an implementation of a GEL pattern, for example if you have a CSS and HTML page that demonstrates the GEL Typography pattern, you can create a sampler page by creating a publicly accessible web page that contains all the examples of typography.</p>

                    <p><strong>The UX&amp;D GEL Team are here to help!</strong> We want to make it easy for you to integrate your work into the BBC's GEL patterns and guidelines. Here's a few of the things we can give you advice on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Set up a project repo in the BBC github space</li>
                        <li>Complete a simple GEL Demo Page template that you can use to show others how your implementation works</li>
                        <li>Build a Sampler Page that will provide evidence to the Test Rig that your implementation is in line with all the GEL guidelines</li>
                        <li>Create a public <code>gh-pages</code> branch to make your Demo and Sample pages accessible to the GEL Test Rig (and other BBC devlopers)</li>
                        <li>Run the GEL Test Rig and get clear red/green feedback</li>
                    </ul>
